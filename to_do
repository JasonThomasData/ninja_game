1. Need to create a way for objects to detect if an enemy is within their melee strike distance
2. Create a way to detect which direction their enemy is in.
3. Have a policy function, which is called inside update(). If exists then give the entity some new
orders
4. Give each enemy a function to detract HP away from itself. Maybe put that in the PhysicalBeing()
object
5. Create some kind of colour filter for all the sprites to show when they've been hit.
Alternatively, push them back a small distance on hit. Possibly both?
