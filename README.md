I'm making this game out of a vague want I had one day to do some pixel art. Not much to say right
now; the code and tests speak for themselves.

Here's some sprites, try to squint really hard.


![ninja_sprite](/css/sprites/ninja.png)
![zombie_sprite](/css/sprites/zombie.png)
![skeleton_sprite](/css/sprites/skeleton.png)
